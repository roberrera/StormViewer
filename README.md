# Storm Viewer

Simple master/detail practice with Swift via the [Project 1 Hacking with Swift tutoral](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/1/setting-up). It uses a master/detail tableView and NSFileManager to let the user tap on a file name and display the storm-related image it represents. The image can then be shared to Facebook or Twitter, or using the iOS share sheet.

(The images used come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and are in the public domain.)
